# Banking Transaction Data Pipeline
This project implements an automated batch data pipeline that processes banking transaction data for reliable end-of-day and monthly reporting. The pipeline ingests raw transaction data, stores it in a data lake, loads it into a data warehouse, and transforms it into analytics-ready tables designed for operational and management reporting.
